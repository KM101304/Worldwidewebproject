The World Wide Web Project – Visual Tribute
This project is a modern visual tribute to the first website ever created by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1991. It preserves the raw essence of the original WorldWideWeb concept while embedding powerful live statistics to reveal the staggering impact the Internet has had on human life.
To visually demonstrate the exponential influence of the Internet—how one page turned into billions, how human life was shaped, created, monetized, and even lost—all through digital connectivity.
